# Linear Regression
## R squared
### Definition
How much of the change in my output is explained by the change in my input.
r² ranges between 0 < r² < 1 – the lower r² the less of the output is explained by change in the input.

## Classification vs. Linear Regression

| property | supervised classification | regression |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | 
| output type | discrete (class labels) | continuous (number) |
| what are you trying to find? | decision boundary | best fit line |
| evaluation | accuracy | sum of squared error |
